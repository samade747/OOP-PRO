# âœ… 4. Payment System â€“ Abstracting Payment Methods

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Payment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCard(Payment):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} using Credit Card.")


class UPI(Payment):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid â‚¹{amount} using UPI.")

# Usage
credit = CreditCard()
credit.pay(500)

upi = UPI()
upi.pay(250)

# ðŸ§  What it teaches:
# User calls pay() without worrying about how itâ€™s done.
