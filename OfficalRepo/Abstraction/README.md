ðŸ§  What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means showing only the necessary details and hiding the complex parts.

ðŸ“¦ Imagine driving a car:

You press the accelerator, but donâ€™t need to know how the engine works.

You just use the carâ€™s interface, not its internal system.

Thatâ€™s abstraction!

ðŸ§© In Python (OOP), abstraction is used to:
Define what should be done (but not how it's done)

Hide the implementation details from the user

Python uses abstract classes and methods to do this.

ðŸ”§ How to do Abstraction in Python?
We use:

ABC â†’ Abstract Base Class

@abstractmethod â†’ Mark a method that must be implemented in child class

These come from abc module (built-in).



| Step | What to Do                              | Why                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1    | Import `ABC` and `abstractmethod`       | To create abstract classes      |
| 2    | Create a class that inherits from `ABC` | This makes it an abstract class |
| 3    | Use `@abstractmethod` in methods        | These must be implemented later |
