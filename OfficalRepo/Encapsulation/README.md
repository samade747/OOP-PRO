âœ… What is Encapsulation in Python?
Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of how something works and only exposing whatâ€™s necessary.

Just like:

A TV remote hides complex circuits and gives you only buttons to control.

A car hides the engine, and you use the steering wheel and pedals to drive.

âœ… Why is Encapsulation important?
It protects data from being accidentally changed.

Makes code easier to understand and maintain.

Helps enforce rules and security.



âœ… How does Encapsulation work in Python?
Python uses classes to support encapsulation.

There are 3 types of access levels for variables and methods:

Access Modifier	Syntax	Meaning
Public	var	Accessible everywhere
Protected	_var	Accessible in class and subclass (by convention)
Private	__var	Hidden from outside access


| Access Type | Declaration   | Accessible From                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Public      | `self.name`   | Anywhere                             |
| Protected   | `self._name`  | Class + Subclasses (suggested only)  |
| Private     | `self.__name` | Only inside the class (name mangled) |



| ðŸ”¢ Concept        | ðŸ’¡ Description                                                              | ðŸ§ª Example Syntax             | ðŸš¦ Access Scope                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access | `class ClassName:`            | Helps in data protection             |
| **Public**        | Can be accessed from anywhere                                               | `self.name`                   | Everywhere                           |
| **Protected**     | Should not be accessed outside the class (but can be); used by convention   | `self._name`                  | Class + Subclass                     |
| **Private**       | Cannot be accessed directly from outside the class                          | `self.__name`                 | Only inside the class                |
| **Getter Method** | Used to **read** a private/protected variable                               | `def get_name(self):`         | Controlled reading of data           |
| **Setter Method** | Used to **update** a private/protected variable                             | `def set_name(self, value):`  | Controlled writing/modifying of data |
| **Why Use It?**   | - Hide internal data  <br> - Enforce validation  <br> - Improve security    | `self.__balance` with getters | Prevents direct unauthorized access  |




| ðŸ’¼ Real-Life Example   | ðŸ”’ Protected Data | âœ… Reason for Encapsulation          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bank Account           | `__balance`       | Prevent fraud or incorrect updates  |
| Student Grades         | `__marks`         | Enforce marks range (0â€“100)         |
| Car Speed Controller   | `__speed`         | Limit speed for safety              |
| Password Manager       | `__password`      | Hide password content               |
| Employee Salary System | `__salary`        | Secure sensitive salary information |
