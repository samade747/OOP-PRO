## 📌 Topics Covered

1. 🧠 **OOP**  
   - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python

2. 🏛️ **Pillars of OOP**  
   - Encapsulation  
   - Abstraction  
   - Inheritance  
   - Polymorphism

3. 🔐 **Encapsulation**  
   - Wrapping data and code together as a single unit  
   - Access modifiers: public, protected, private
   - https://github.com/samade747/OOP-PRO/tree/main/OfficalRepo/Encapsulation

4. 🎭 **Abstraction**  
   - Hiding internal implementation and showing only necessary details
   - https://github.com/samade747/OOP-PRO/tree/main/OfficalRepo/Abstraction

5. 👪 **Inheritance**  
   - Acquiring properties and behaviors from a parent class
  
   - https://github.com/samade747/OOP-PRO/blob/main/OfficalRepo/Inheritance/README.md

6. 🔁 **Polymorphism**  
   - Multiple forms: method overloading and method overriding
   - https://github.com/samade747/OOP-PRO/tree/main/OfficalRepo/Polymorphism

7. ⚔️ **OOP vs Procedural Programming**  
   - Key differences and use cases

8. 🧱 **Basics of Classes and Objects**  
   - 👤 *Classes*: Blueprints for creating objects  
   - 🧩 *Objects*: Instances of classes

9. 🛠️ **Attributes and Methods**  
   - Instance variables  
   - Class variables  
   - Instance methods

10. 🏗️ **Constructors**  
    - `__init__` method to initialize objects

11. 🧨 **Destructors**  
    - `__del__` method to clean up when an object is deleted

12. 🆚 **Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes**  
    - Shared vs unique data among instances

13. 🏷️ **@classmethod**  
    - Methods that take the class as the first argument

14. 🧷 **@staticmethod**  
    - Methods that don’t take instance or class as a parameter

15. 👤 **@instancemethod**  
    - Regular methods that operate on instance data
