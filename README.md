7. ⚔️ **OOP vs Procedural Programming**  
   - Key differences and use cases

8. 🧱 **Basics of Classes and Objects**  
   - 👤 *Classes*: Blueprints for creating objects  
   - 🧩 *Objects*: Instances of classes

9. 🛠️ **Attributes and Methods**  
   - Instance variables  
   - Class variables  
   - Instance methods

10. 🏗️ **Constructors**  
    - `__init__` method to initialize objects

11. 🧨 **Destructors**  
    - `__del__` method to clean up when an object is deleted

12. 🆚 **Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes**  
    - Shared vs unique data among instances
