# What is a Constructor?
# A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It’s used to initialize the object’s attributes or perform any setup required for the object.

# In Python, the constructor method is named __init__

# The __init__ Method
# The __init__ method is the most commonly used constructor in Python. It’s called whenever a new instance of a class is created. You can define this method to initialize the object’s attributes or perform other setup tasks.

# Syntax:Parameterized Constructors
# A parameterized constructor takes parameters (arguments) when creating an object. These parameters are used to initialize the object’s attributes.

# Example:




# CLass
        Method
        Attribute
        Class variables
