1. What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and classes, rather than functions and logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their relationships in a more intuitive and structured way.

For example, if you‚Äôre building a car simulation, you might create a Car class. Each car in your program would be an object (instance) of that class, with attributes like color, speed, and model, and behaviors like accelerate() or brake().

Why use OOP?
Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, reusable components (objects).

Reusability: Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of a program or in entirely different programs.

Maintainability: Code is easier to maintain and update because it‚Äôs organized into logical units.

Scalability: OOP makes it easier to scale and extend programs as requirements grow.

Real-world modeling: OOP closely mirrors real-world entities, making it easier to understand and design systems.



Key Principles of OOP
OOP is built on four fundamental principles:

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism


üîê Encapsulation
Wraps data and methods into a single unit (class).
Restricts direct access to internal data (using private/protected attributes).
Helps maintain control, security, and integrity of the data.
üé≠ Abstraction
Hides complex implementation details from the user.
Shows only the essential features and relevant information.
Makes the interface simple while managing complexity behind the scenes.
üß¨ Inheritance
Allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another (parent).
Promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.
hild class can override or extend parent functionality.
üîÅ Polymorphism
Lets one interface be used for different underlying data types or classes.
The same method name can behave differently based on the object.
Supports flexibility and scalability in code design.
